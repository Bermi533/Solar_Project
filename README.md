## Solar Project

The main goal of this project is to provide clear, visual, and conceptual tools to assist in understanding the basic concepts of particle acceleration processes in the Sun and their role in producing hard X-rays (HXRs).

Rather than focusing on detailed modeling or observational data, the objective is to emphasize an intuitive understanding of acceleration mechanisms along with visualizations of field structures and particle behavior.
